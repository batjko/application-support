On Application Support
======================

This repository is a placeholder for a **collaborative** book on Application Support for new and seasoned ***AppSupp*** professionals, and additional resources. Feel free to suggest new chapters, paragraphs, utilities and other helpful resources. Or write entire sections and chapters. In the end this should really represent the collective experience of as many Application Support experts as possible.

See [SUMMARY.md](./SUMMARY.md) for the table of contents!

In order to contribute, by adding content, writing paragraphs or whole chapters, correcting my grammar or bad wording etc... please don't hesitate to [fork/clone](http://github.com/batjko/application-support) the living daylights out of this thing and send me your pull requests!

***TODO:*** bloody everything...

1. ~~Create Structure~~
2. ~~Add README files to each chapter~~
3. Create some actual content!
