About This Book
===============

There is precious little literature on Application Support out there.
Don't get me wrong: there's plenty on IT Support, ITIL practices and general Support guidelines etc.
But there appears to be some kind of consensus that Application Support is nothing but standard IT Support, just with a particular focus on some insignificant niche piece of software. So it surely has no need for any special  attention.

However, I think there is a lot to this role which distinguishes it from other technical Support roles, with its very own unique challenges and opportunities.

So while a lot of the particulars of an Application Support job are overlapping with other Support functions, we will also spend some time exploring those unique and special parts of it.

Overall, our aim will be to familiarize you with Application Support, from the perspective of a new starter, then seamlessly to that of a seasoned expert, and finally to all the important considerations of a leader of such an Application Support team.  
So whether you're just a green enthusiastic newbie starting out, or already looking back onto years of troubleshooting application nightmares, the final version should be a useful read for you.

If not, please help improve this by sending me [feedback](./Usage_Policy.md) or even [contributing](../CONTRIBUTE.md) some new content yourself!

Now, let's get to it...
