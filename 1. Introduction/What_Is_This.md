About This Book
===============

There is precious little literature on Application Support out there.
Don't get me wrong: there's plenty on IT Support, ITIL practices and general Support guidelines etc.
But there appears to be some kind of uninformed consensus that Application Support is not much more than standard IT Support, just with a particular focus on some insignificant niche piece of software. So it surely has no need for any special attention.

However, there is a lot to this role, which is often advertised under a whole bunch of different names (usually the name of the software, the department or the business process, followed by "... Support Engineer", "... Specialist" or "... Analyst" and the like). And what distinguishes it from other technical Support roles, is that it has its own unique challenges - and opportunities - which generic Tech Support doesn't usually come across.

Chief among them is the fact that we're dealing mostly with specialized software, supporting specific business processes, sometimes written in-house and only used and supported in that one company. And yes, that has challenges, such as the rarely existing documentation and the only expert leaving the company in a week; as well as certain opportunities: How does mastering a new system from scratch and quickly becoming the go-to expert yourself sound? It usually comes with VIP access to improve the system via customizations and tweaks, honing your analysis and development skills along the way.
You never learn as much, as quickly, as in the first three months after joining a new team that supports some obscure, hyper-specialized piece of business software.

So while a lot of the particulars of an Application Support job are overlapping with other Support functions, we will also spend some time exploring those unique and special parts of it.

Overall, our aim will be to familiarize you with Application Support, from the perspective of a new starter, then seamlessly to that of a seasoned expert, and finally to all the important considerations of a leader of such an Application Support team.  
So whether you're just a green enthusiastic newbie starting out, or already looking back onto years of troubleshooting application nightmares, the final version should be a useful read for you.
